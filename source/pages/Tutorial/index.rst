Setting up
===============================

Are you looking to setup a development instance of the decompfrontier repositories?
This page will assist you in setting up both a development client and development server,
as well as the infrastructure for the client decompilation.

.. important::

    The Brave Frontier Windows client currently *DOES NOT* work
    under Wine as Wine does not support WinRT/XAML Apps.
    Use of a Virtual machine is suggested for running the client.

.. note::

    The client only supports Windows currently,
    Android or iOS patches are not supported yet.

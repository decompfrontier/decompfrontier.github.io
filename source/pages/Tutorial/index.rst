Tutorial
===============================

This page aims to hold some tutorials/help to setup the decompfrontier repositories and similar
administration stuff.

.. important::

    The Brave Frontier Windows client currently *DOES NOT* work
    under Wine as Wine does not support WinRT/XAML Apps.
    Use of a Virtual machine is suggested for running the client.

.. note::

    The client only supports Windows currently,
    Android or iOS patches are not supported yet.

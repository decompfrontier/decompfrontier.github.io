How to contribute
===========================

The workflow of contributing to any decompfrontier project is done via Pull requests (PR)/Issues
on Github, therefore, a Github account and a Git client should be installed in your computer.

When creating a new Issue, please check if any similar issue wasn't already created by
another user or a related PR has already been created.

If you are working on a patch and would like to send a work in progress PR to allow
developers to review some portion of the code or to let people aware of your progress,
please add the suffix "Draft: " in your PR title.
